An Ant nimbly running about in the sunshine in search of food came
across a Chrysalis that was very near its time of change The
Chrysalis moved its tail and thus attracted the attention of the Ant
who then saw for the first time that it was alive Poor pitiable
animal cried the Ant disdainfully What a sad fate is yours
While I can run hither and thither at my pleasure and if I wish
ascend the tallest tree you lie imprisoned here in your shell with
power only to move a joint or two of your scaly tail The Chrysalis
heard all this but did not try to make any reply A few days after
when the Ant passed that way again nothing but the shell remained
Wondering what had become of its contents he felt himself suddenly
shaded and fanned by the gorgeous wings of a beautiful Butterfly
Behold in me said the Butterfly your much-pitied friend Boast
now of your powers to run and climb as long as you can get me to
listen So saying the Butterfly rose in the air and borne along
and aloft on the summer breeze was soon lost to the sight of the
Ant forever
